### Authorization errors

iumiCash follows industry standard OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol and returns the 
`HTTP 400`, `HTTP 401`, `HTTP 403` status codes for authorization errors. 

!!! Tip

    Most of them usually access token-related issues and can be cleared by making sure 
    that the token is present and hasn't expired.

    | `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` | For example: <ul><li>Authorization header is not present</li><li>Invalid client credentials</li><li>Invalid refresh_token</li><li>Invalid authorization code etc</li></ul> |
    | `HTTP 403 Forbidden` | Authorization failed due to insufficient permissions | Make sure that you have access to this resource. |

    !!! danger
        
        Be carefull! For `HTTP 5xx` status codes, iumiCash can send **NOT** `application/json` response type. It may happen when iumiCash servers somehow is down. `HTTP 5xx` status codes in most cases sent by `reverse proxies` e.g. [nginx](https://nginx.org/), [traefik](https://traefik.io/) in `text/plain` response type.
